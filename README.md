# cosc439FinalProject
Script used with COSC 439 (Operating Systems) final project

steps.sh is a bash script which automates the non-packet capturing steps of the demonstration (i.e. the tracking of internal mechanisms).
NOTE: due to the unpredictable nature of hardware input events before and after switching keyboards, the "cat <event>" commands must still be done manually if desired in conjunction with this script.

USE: Save the file, and run "bash steps.sh" as root

Begin execution before making the keyboard switch and press enter (as it will instruct you) after the switch once youâ€™ve decided to finish.

When complete, the script will have left an output folder named "ScriptOutput" where all the details from execution can be found.
